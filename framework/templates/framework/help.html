<li>-Inicie sesión, si no tiene una cuenta, puede proceder a registrarse</li>
<li>-Una vez ingrese, puede dar clic en 'Nueva evaluación' y crear su nueva evaluación</li>
<li>-Hecho esto, proceda a agregar un principio a su evaluación, seleccionando el principio, el grado, esto seguido de una justificación.</li>
<li>-Después de haber creado su principio, puede proceder a agregar evidencias, eligiendo el tipo y dejando una descripción de esta</li>
<li>-Luego podrá evaluar su estrategia, obteniendo así un % total gamificado según las pautas de MEEJEL.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A continuación, podrá encontrar tablas, las cuales en caso de ser necesario podran servirle de apoyo al momento de usar MEEJEL</h4>
